# Layth Ayache — Technical Architect

> Technical architect building production-grade public information infrastructure. Systems designed for reliability, accountability, and scale.

## About

Layth Ayache is a technical architect and infrastructure engineer based in Lebanon. He specializes in distributed data pipelines, change detection systems, API design, and production engineering. His work focuses on systems that serve public needs — accessibility, information infrastructure, and structured data access.

## Flagship Projects

### Public Information Infrastructure
Production-grade infrastructure for collecting, normalizing, and serving public media data. Tracks changes, ensures provenance, provides structured API access to information that matters.
- Role: Technical Architect & Lead Engineer
- Stack: TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Python
- Status: Active, in production
- URL: https://laythayache.com/projects/public-information-infrastructure

### OmniSign
Privacy-first sign language translation system with federated learning. 89% alphabet accuracy, on-device inference, federated learning across distributed nodes.
- Role: Federated Learning Architect (team of 6)
- Stack: TensorFlow, MediaPipe, React Native, TypeScript, Python
- Status: Completed
- URL: https://laythayache.com/projects/omnisign

## Technical Skills

- Languages: TypeScript, Python, Node.js
- Data: PostgreSQL, Redis
- ML: TensorFlow, MediaPipe
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- Architecture: REST APIs, distributed systems, data pipelines, change detection, federated learning

## Design Principles

1. Reliability under uncertainty — systems fail; plan for degradation and graceful fallbacks
2. Clear interfaces — boundaries between humans and systems explicit and obvious
3. Auditability by design — every state change traceable: what, when, why, who
4. Performance as constraint — latency and throughput are architecture decisions
5. Security as architecture — vulnerabilities fixed structurally, not patched
